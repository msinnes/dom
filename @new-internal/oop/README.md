# `@internal/oop`

A lightweight library for basic object oriented patterns not present in core JavaScript.

## abstract

Makes a class abstract. Uses ES6 to extend the class. This is a runtime abstraction.

## abstractMethod

Makes a class abstract by creating an abstract method. This should be implemented in a class constructor, and the instance will be checked for the method when it is created. This is a runtime abstraction.

## extendz

Will check to see if one class extends another.
